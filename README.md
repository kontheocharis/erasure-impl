## Type theory with erasure

Toy implementation of type theory with erasure as a phase distinction.

For type formers we only have mode-aware Π, and U. The notation is:

```haskell
(0 x : A) -> B -- erased Π
(x : A) -> B   -- runtime Π
```

Terms are split into two modes: `ω a : A` is a runtime term, and `0 a : A` is an erased term.

The rules are:
- If `ω a : A` then `0 (↓ a) : A`.
- If  `0 a : A` and a special symbol `#` is in scope, then `ω (↑ a) : A`.
- The symbol `#` is called the erasure marker and comes into scope when going under a `↓`.
- Types are always erased.
- The `↓`/`↑` coercions and the `#` symbol are fully elaborated in; the user cannot interact with them.
- On the surface, the language behaves just like `QTT({0, ω})`.

There are two implementations contained here: `explicit` and `implicit`. The
input language is the same, the difference is the elaborated output. We show
this difference with the Church encoding of `Fin`. First, this is the
source-level input:

```haskell
let 0 Fin : Nat -> U
= \n . (0 A : Nat -> U)
  -> ({0 k : Nat} -> A (succ k))
  -> ({0 k : Nat} -> A k -> A (succ k))
  -> A n;
```

- `explicit`: the syntax includes the coercions between runtime and erased
  terms, added during elaboration. `Fin` becomes

  ```haskell
  let 0 Fin : Nat → U
  = ↓ (λ n. ↑ ((0 A : Nat → U)
    → ({0 k : Nat} → ↓ (↑ A) (succ (↑ k)))
    → ({0 k : Nat} → (↓ (↑ A) (↑ k)) → ↓ (↑ A) (succ (↑ k)))
    → ↓ (↑ A) n));
  ```
  
  This means we see exactly when we use a term in a mode other than the one it is
  inherently from.

- `implicit`: this does not include explicit coercions; this is possible only
  when the runtime and erased languages are the same. It is much closer to the
  way Idris2 or Agda implement erasure (QTT). The output looks very close to the input.
  `Fin` becomes
  
  ```haskell
  let 0 Fin : Nat → U
  = λ n. (0 A : Nat → U)
    → ({0 k : Nat} → A (succ k))
    → ({0 k : Nat} → A k → A (succ k))
    → A n;
  ```
  
  **Warning**: `implicit` still a work-in-progress.
  
### Discussion
  
If you don't care about disparity between the two phases, you should implement
your language in the way `implicit` does, as it is simpler and perhaps more
performant. That being said, `explicit` has its merits too: if you want to have
things in the runtime phase that collapse in the compile-time phase, then you
need explicit coercions. (More on that soon)

I have not measured it yet but the performance gap should be negligible because
there is no deep traversal happening during eval/quote and the value
representation of coercions is quite efficient. 

There is also a code extraction capability invoked with the `ex` flag, that spits
out untyped lambda calculus terms, removing all erased/compile-time data.

Erasure in this style can (in theory) be directly combined with 2LTT approaches.

There is also an [explanation](./notes/pattern-unification.md) about how to do
pattern unification in this system.
